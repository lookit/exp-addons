            We'll be analyzing where your child chooses to look during the videos--but only if we can tell where that is!
            Please check each of the following to ensure we're able to use your video:
        </p>

        <ol>

            <li>
                <span class='exp-video-config-quality-summary'>Make sure the webcam you're using is roughly centered</span>
                relative to this monitor. This makes it much easier for us to tell whether your child is looking to the
                left or right!
                <img class="example" src="assets/centering.png" alt="Center the webcam">
            </li>


            <li>
                <span class='exp-video-config-quality-summary'>Turn off any other monitors</span> connected to your
                computer, besides the one with the centered webcam. (If there's just one monitor, you're all set!)
                <img class="example" src="assets/monitors.png" alt="Turn off other monitors">
            </li>


            <li>
                Check the lighting by making sure you can <span class='exp-video-config-quality-summary'>clearly see your own eyes</span> on
                the webcam view to the right. You may need to either turn on a light or reduce light coming from behind you.

            </li>


            <li>
                During the study, we'll ask that you sit facing away from the monitor, holding your child over your shoulder, like this. (More on that in a moment!)
                <span class='exp-video-config-quality-summary'>Make sure the webcam is angled up or down enough that your child's eyes are visible in this position</span>.
                <img class="example" src="assets/over_shoulder.jpg" alt="Adjust the height">
            </li>


            <li>
                If it's practical, <span class='exp-video-config-quality-summary'>minimize exciting things</span> that
                are visible behind or to the side of the screen-- for instance, by facing a wall instead of the kitchen.
                (If this isn't practical for you, don't worry about it!)
