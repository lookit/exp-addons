            {{#bs-accordion-item value="mobile" title="Are you using a computer, not a mobile device?"}}
                <p> Unfortunately, Lookit doesn't work on mobile devices like phones and tablets yet.</p>
            {{/bs-accordion-item}}

            {{#bs-accordion-item value="browsers" title="Are you using a recent version of Chrome or Firefox?"}}
                <p> Lookit is currently only officially supported on Chrome and Firefox. Specific setup directions for each are below! </p>

                    <li> Click the green lock icon to the left of the web address. Set Camera and Microphone to "always allow on this site."

                    <li>
                        Find the website address bar at the top. There should be an “i” with a circle around it, then a grey Lego-like icon, then a security icon, like this:

                    <li>
                        Click on the Lego icon, and a window should pop up asking permission to use Adobe Flash on this site. Check the "Remember" box and click Allow:

                    If the microphone icon in your video screen shows red bars like this <img src="assets/noSound.png" alt="No sound">, or if you can't see any green when you make noise, you may not be recording sound. To adjust your microphone settings, right-click on the webcam view and choose "Settings":

                        First, you are a very dedicated citizen scientist and we're grateful for your help! We're sorry you're having trouble and are actively working on this system.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Make sure you're able to view your webcam video outside of Lookit. (For example, on a Mac, try Photobooth.)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The easiest approach may be to try a different web browser if you have one installed anyway. For instance, if you're using Firefox, switch to Chrome, or vice versa. Also, update the browser if you're not using the latest version. You can check by going to "Chrome" -> "About Chrome" or "Firefox" -> "About Firefox" in the menu bar. (This is a good idea to make sure you've gotten any security updates anyway.) Still not working?
