                Important: your child does not need to be with you until the videos begin. First, let's go over what
                will happen!

            In this study, your child will see 24 short video clips of physical events. Before each segment, a
            woman will introduce an object ("Look, this is a ball!") Then, on one side of the screen, something "normal"
            will happen to that object: for example, the ball will roll off a table and fall to the ground. On the other
            side, something surprising will happen: the same ball will roll off the table and fall up! Each video clip takes under 30 seconds. We're interested in where your child chooses to look. A
            tendency to look either at the expected or the unexpected videos, if it's consistent across different types of events,
            demonstrates that your child may be making predictions about what will happen!
        </p>

        <p>
            There are also some "control" video clips where the left and right sides are very similar, or where one side
            moves and the other doesn't. These are to measure your child's basic "looking personality": for instance,
            does he or she prefer to look at the same thing for a while, or switch back and forth?
        </p>

            Altogether, the video section is about 12 minutes long. After the videos, youâ€™ll give any feedback and
            select a privacy level for your webcam recording.
