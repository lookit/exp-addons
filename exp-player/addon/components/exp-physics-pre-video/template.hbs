                holding your child so he/she can look over your shoulder. Don't look at the videos yourself, or we may
                not be able to use your child's data! You'll hear spoken updates (“video 5,” etc.) and an all-clear at

                You can direct your child's attention by saying things like "What's happening?" But
                <em>please don't talk about specific things that might be happening in the videos</em> ("Do you see
                a ball? Is that ball doing something silly?")<br>

        <ul>

                If your child gets fussy or distracted, or you need to attend to something else for a moment,
                <em>press the space bar to pause the study.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you won't be back for at least an hour, just <em>close this window or tab to end the session</em>.
                You'll be prompted to note any technical problems you're experiencing and to select a privacy level for
                your videos.
