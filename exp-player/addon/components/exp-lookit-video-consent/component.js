Video consent frame for Lookit studies, with consent document displayed at left and instructions to start recording, read a statement out loud, and send. A standard consent
document is displayed, with additional study-specific information provided by the researcher, in accordance with the Lookit terms of use. Consent document can be downloaded as PDF document by participant.

        "procedures": "Your child will be shown pictures of lots of different cats, along with noises that cats make like meowing and purring. We are interested in which pictures and sounds make your child smile. We will ask you (the parent) to turn around to avoid influencing your child's responses. There are no anticipated risks associated with participating.",
        "payment": "After you finish the study, we will email you a $5 BabyStore gift card within approximately three days. To be eligible for the gift card your child must be in the age range for this study, you need to submit a valid consent statement, and we need to see that there is a child with you. But we will send a gift card even if you do not finish the whole study or we are not able to use your child's data! There are no other direct benefits to you or your child from participating, but we hope you will enjoy the experience.",
        "datause": "We are primarily interested in your child's emotional reactions to the images and sounds. A research assistant will watch your video to measure the precise amount of delight in your child's face as he or she sees each cat picture."
