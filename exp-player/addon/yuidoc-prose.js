/**
 * Reusable randomizers that can be used as part of user-defined experiments.
 * Randomizers allow researchers to specify how to select which frames or
 * sequences of frames to use as part of a particular session of a given
 * experiment, for instance in order to counterbalance stimuli used across
 * subjects, assign subjects randomly to different experimental conditions, or
 * implement a longitudinal design where the frames used in this study depend on
 * the frames used in the participant's last session.
