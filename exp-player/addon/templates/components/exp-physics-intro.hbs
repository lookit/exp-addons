  <p><b>Important: your child does not need to be with you until the videos begin. First, let's go over what will happen!</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>In this study, your child will see about 24 short video clips of physical events. Before each segment, a woman will introduce an object ("Look, this is a ball!") Then, on one side of the screen, something "normal" will  happen to that object: for example, the ball will roll off a table and fall to the ground. On the other side, something surprising will happen: the same ball will roll off the table and fall up! Each pair of event videos will play for about 20 seconds. We're interested in where your child chooses to look. A tendency to look either at the expected or the unexpected videos, if it's consistent across many events, demonstrates that your child can tell the difference and may be making predictions about what "should"  happen!</p>
  <br>
  <p>There are also some "control" video clips where the left and right sides are very similar, or where one side moves and the other doesn't. These are to measure your child's basic "looking personality": for instance, does he or she prefer to look at the same thing for a while, or switch back and forth?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Altogether, the video section is about 12 minutes long. After the videos, you’ll give any feedback and select a privacy level for your webcam recording.</p>
