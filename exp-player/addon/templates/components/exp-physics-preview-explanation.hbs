  <p>During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder, so that you face away from the screen. </p>

  <br>
  <p>The reason we ask this is that your child is learning from you all the time. Even if he or she can't see where you're looking, you may unconsciously shift to face the "unexpected" events and influence your child's attention. We want to make sure we're measuring your child's own intuitions, rather than yours!</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. Please do this without your child, so that these particular videos will be new to him or her!</p>
