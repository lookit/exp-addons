    /*  Arguments:
    frameId: An ID for the set of frames being created, provided by the end user in their
        study JSON as the ID for this randomizer frame (e.g. 'test-trials')
    frameConfig: This object contains all the properties the end user of your randomizer
        specifies in their study JSON. E.g., if a property 'startOnLeft' is provided, you
        can access it as frameConfig.startOnLeft.
    pastSessions: A list of all past sessions for this study/participant pair, from newest
        to oldest. Each session has the data corresponding to the "response" data described here:
        https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/experimentdata.html#structure-of-session-data
    resolveFrame: A function that takes a frame ID and frame object and resolves any
        dependencies to return [resolvedFrames, conditions], just like this randomizer does.
        If you have created a single frame to return (an object with properties corresponding to
        the info that frame type needs), you can resolve it using
        resolveFrame(yourFrameID, yourFrame)[0] (which will be a list of your one frame).
        If you are making a sequence of frames (e.g. deciding the order of a set of frames),
        you will need to put the resolved lists together.
